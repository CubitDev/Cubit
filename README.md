What is Cubit?
--------------

Cubit is an experimental digital currency that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world. Cubit Core uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried
out collectively by the Cubit Core network. Cubit Core is the name of the software
which enables the use of the Cubit currency.

Cubit ore diverted from mainstream forks. The reason for this is that Cubit wants
to be true to the original vision of "Satoshi Nakamoto." Nothing more than CPU
power to mine Cubit coins. No single party is to "own" the Cubit Core  blockchain.

For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of
the Cubit client software, see http://download.cubitcore.org
